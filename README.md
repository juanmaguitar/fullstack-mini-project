# FullStack Mini Project

This is a mini project that shows how to serve a static project (build w/ AngularJs ) using Node.js + express

## Installation

To install dependencies you must do first of all

```
npm install
```

## Launch

To launch the server you can do

```
node app
```

This will start a web server listening on port 3000, so if you go to the url `localhost:3000` in your browser you should see the content produced by `public/index.html` built w/ AngularJS
